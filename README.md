# ionic-polyfill-bundler

This a way to compile the different stencil polyfills outside of the stencil project. It has a focus of getting edge up and running with ionic react.

The build generates an ionic-polyfill.js in the poly folder. This is intended as a temporary fix for node.js builds while we wait for the release of the new Edge.

You can import this file via a script tag first thing in your code.
